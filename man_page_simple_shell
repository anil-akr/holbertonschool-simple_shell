SIMPLE_SHELL(1)

NAME
simple_shell - a simple UNIX command line interpreter

SYNOPSIS
simple_shell

DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is a simplified UNIX command line interpreter developed
as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

```
The shell displays a prompt, reads user commands from standard input,
and executes them using system calls such as fork(), execve(), and wait().

It supports execution of commands using absolute paths or by searching
through the PATH environment variable.

The shell works in both interactive and non-interactive modes.
```

FEATURES
- Displays a prompt and waits for user input
- Executes commands using absolute paths
- Executes commands using the PATH environment variable
- Handles commands with arguments
- Implements built-in commands: exit and env
- Handles EOF (Ctrl+D)
- Displays error messages when commands are not found

BUILT-IN COMMANDS
exit
Exits the shell.
This command does not accept arguments.

```
env
    Prints the current environment variables.
```

NON-INTERACTIVE MODE
simple_shell can execute commands from standard input:

```
    echo "/bin/ls" | ./simple_shell

In this mode, the prompt is not displayed.
```

ERROR HANDLING
If a command cannot be found, an error message is printed and the
shell continues execution.

```
fork() is never called if the command does not exist.
```

LIMITATIONS
The shell does not support:

```
- Command separators (;)
- Pipes (|)
- Redirections (>, <, >>)
- Special characters (", ', \, *, &, #)
- Aliases or environment variable modification
```

EXIT STATUS
simple_shell always exits with status 0 unless terminated by an error
related to system calls.

ENVIRONMENT
